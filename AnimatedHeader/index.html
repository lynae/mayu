                    <p>One of the biggest problems with a formal education for web design is that the industry changes too quickly. New technology and new trends mean that by the time you are done with your education much of what you learned will already be obsolete or somewhat dated.</p>
                    <p>"It's nice that you have a Comp Sci degree... it's nice that you are Oracle Certified... but based on your lack of experience, I cannot say that you are the right fit for this position." -interviewer, <a href="http://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/e/5/a/e5a92c4229e70eed/18b-Education.mp3?c_id=3423032&expiration=1400260905&hwt=e6b826aa96e0ad80310387085bff40e4">The Developer's Life Education Podcast</a>

                    <p>Boot Camps:</p>
                    <p>In these programs you work in pair programming, on several exercises, and have access to local guest lectures-- but what about the staff running your organization? How many years experience does your instructor have? What projects or companies have they contributed to?</p>
                    <p>"Programming boot camps can't serve as a substitute for real-world experience," says <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/article/2096390/java-android-developer/boom-or-bust-the-lowdown-on-code-academies.html">John LeBlanc</a>, head of developer evangelism at Pay Pal</p>

                    <p>Self Taught:</p>
                    <p>Taking this route has major financial advantages compared to spending tens of thousands of dollars on a formal education or bootcamp program. You can also specify your curriculum and learn exactly what you want to learn. On the downside, without a mentor you are likely to learn out-of-date technologies or methods. This often results in educational gaps and obvious lack of understanding coding best practices.</p>

                    <p>How It Works</p>
                    <p>Compared to learning alternatives, the Mayu Academy Apprentice Program creates Mid to Senior level developers, as opposed to Junior level developers with lower starting salaries.</p>
                    <p>No Debt Model:</p>
                    <p>As opposed to paying an upfront tuition, apprentices are paid for contracts during the program, but required to pay Mayu Academy 20% of their first year salary. This is a no-debt model that also increases your starting salary potential faster than bootcamps.</p>
                    <p>Experience Demand Addressed:</p>
                    <p>The majority of public job openings today require 3 or more years experience for developer positions. With US colleges producing 40,000 developers a year and over 1.4 million developer jobs opening by 2020, where are the recent grads to go? Beyond general industry demand, there are too many jobs, too many novices, and not enough experienced developers to fill the positions. At Mayu Academy, we thoroughly researched what 3 years experience as a developer means. After cross referencing several dozen job descriptions and talking with real companies about this issue, we have developed our curriculum designed to mimic 3 years of professional experience.</p>
