                                    <p>One of the biggest problems with getting a formal education for web design and development is that the industry changes too quickly. New technology and new trends mean that by the time you are done with your education much of what you have learned will already be obsolete or at least somewhat dated.</p>

How many years experience does your instructor have? What projects or companies have they contributed to?</p>

                                    <p>Taking this route has major financial advantages compared to spending tens of thousands of dollars on a formal education or bootcamp program. You can also specify your curriculum and learn exactly what you want to learn. On the downside, without a mentor you are likely to learn out-of-date technologies or methods. This often results in educational gaps and obvious lack of understanding coding best practices.</p>
